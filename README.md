# Generic-Collections-in-C
Or How to Pretend C++ Doesn't Exist

This repo is intended to be part of code portfolio, showcasing miscellaneous skills and achievements to potential employers. **This code is not intended for reuse.**

### Included Collections
* Queue
* Singly linked list
* Stack

This repo contains implementation of common data collections in C. Genericism is achieved through the use void pointers and function pointers.

This project came to be during my second year at the Dublin Institute of Technology. We were covering linked lists, queues, and stacks in lectures and labs and were asked to write our own implementations. (Yes, I know that's a 1st year topic.) I had already done this a few years before in my own time so I decided to set a challenge: fully generic implementations.

These implementations support any type including primitives, pointers, arrays, and structures. They can be used to make shallow or deep copies of data.
